Data Analytics project where I analyzed Customer Shopping Behavior \nto uncover trends in sales, demographics, and purchasing habits.This project was a great exercise in building a complete data pipeline.

Analytical Questions & Answers

1. What is the demographic breakdown of the customer base?
Answer: The customer base is predominantly Male, accounting for 2,652 customers compared to 1,248 Female customers. In terms of age groups, Seniors (1,482) and Adults (1,244) are the most active shoppers, while the "Young" demographic (69) represents the smallest segment.

2. Which product category generates the highest revenue?
Answer: Clothing is the clear leader, generating a total revenue of **$104,264**. It is followed by Accessories ($74,200), Footwear ($36,093), and Outerwear ($18,524).

3. Does a customer’s subscription status significantly impact their average purchase amount?
Answer: Surprisingly, no. The average purchase amount for non-subscribers is $59.87, while for subscribers it is $59.49. This suggests that while subscriptions might help with retention (frequency), they do not necessarily increase the value of individual transactions.

4. Which payment methods are most preferred by shoppers?

5. How do sales performance and total spending vary by season?
Answer: Fall is the peak shopping season with a total revenue of **$60,018**. Spring ($58,679) and Winter ($58,607) follow closely, while Summer shows the lowest revenue at $55,777.

6. Which product category has the highest customer satisfaction based on ratings?
Answer: Footwear holds the highest average review rating at 3.79, followed by Accessories (3.77). Although Clothing brings in the most revenue, its average rating is slightly lower at 3.72.

Key Insights for Data Analytics

Male-Centric Marketing: With males making up over 65% of the dataset, marketing campaigns and inventory selection should be heavily weighted toward male-oriented products and styles to maximize ROI.

Clothing is the Core Driver: Since Clothing accounts for nearly 45% of total revenue, it should remain the primary focus of inventory management. However, there is an opportunity to "upsell" accessories to the large clothing-buying audience.

Subscription Strategy Review: Since subscribers and non-subscribers spend roughly the same amount per transaction, the value of the subscription program likely lies in "Frequency of Purchase" rather than "Transaction Value." The business should focus on using subscriptions to increase the number of annual visits.

Payment Versatility: The balanced use of all payment methods indicates a diverse customer base. Maintaining support for various digital wallets (PayPal, Venmo) and traditional methods (Cash, Credit Card) is essential for customer convenience.

Seasonal Consistency: While Fall is the strongest season, the variance between the highest and lowest seasons is only about 7%. This indicates a stable, year-round business model that isn't overly reliant on a single holiday period.

Quality Control in Clothing: Despite being the top seller, Clothing has the lowest average rating among categories. Investigating the "Bad" or "Very Bad" reviews specifically for clothing items could reveal quality or sizing issues that, if fixed, could further boost sales.
